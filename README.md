Amurrica!
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'America' with 'Amurrica!'

Heavy inspiration (and this fork derives from) comes from [Cloud to Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).  Thanks [PanicSteve](https://github.com/panicsteve/)!

[Direct download of CRX extension here](https://github.com/owocki/amurrica/blob/master/Amurica.crx?raw=true).

Happy 4th of July!
